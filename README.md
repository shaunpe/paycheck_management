General Info
------------

The program was developed to produce a fast and organized paycheck reports while considering different variables for each of the employees, such as: commission rates, employee benefits, sale quotas, etc.

Design
------

The program is implemented in C++ and initially creates two text files:
1. employees' data such as name, id, type, etc.
2. and a well-formatted printable paycheck reports for all employees.   

Data will be inserted by the user through the program's main menu and will be stored in a two-dimensional array. This allows entering the data in any order (different employees or dates) and after computation the arrays will sort by employee and date and a 50-line report (equivalent to 1 printable page) will be generated for each employee.
